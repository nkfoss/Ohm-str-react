# Omega-Strength

Omega Strength (abrv: Ohm-Str) is an application for strength trainers to track their results, and calculate their progress. 
The application uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and will be hosted on a Digital Ocean virtual machine.

### The Beginning

Ohm-str did not always use the current stack and is currently undergoing a significant recreation. This app started with Angular and Firebase (realtime and hosting). It was originally a small project for Nate to test his Angular understanding, as well as personal usage for strength training. Michael, Nate's college friend and fellow student of Angular, became interested in the project and began to contribute towards the end of the Angular version. As of now, the Angular version is done being developed.

Both developers having an interest in React, Michael and Nate decided to rebuild (and continue developing) this app with the new stack. Michael kickstarted the process with a rough skeleton comprising the interface and architecture. You can see his original creation here: https://github.com/michael-small/strength-star

### Current Status

We are currently sketching out the basics of the new database setup. With Firebase much of the work was already done, so there is a significant amount of new territory in setting up Mongo. In addition, we are currently learning more about React everyday and are in discussions about practices related to the part of the project.
