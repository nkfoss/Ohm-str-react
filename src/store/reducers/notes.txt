This is the folder where the action-reducers live.

Each action-reducer has a corresponding action-creator/action-type in the '../actions' folder.

Action-reducers have a couple key things:
	1) An initial state
	2) A reducer function that receives the current state, and action type (string).
	... It is usually composed of a big switch-statement where
	... each case corresponds to an action created in the action-creator file.
	... The case returns a new object representing the updated state.

The actiontypes are constants that are imported from the '../actions/actionTypes.js'
