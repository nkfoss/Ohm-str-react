This is the folder where the action-creators live.

Each action-creator file has a name that describes what part of the state it works with, or which component.
... EXAMPLE: 'order.js'  or  'burgerBuilder.js'

Inside the files, there are exported functions that eventually trigger an action reducer.
The functions either do this directly or indirectly.

This is also where asynchronous code is called, which will indirectly trigger an action reducer.

There are also some accessory files that make things easier:
	1) actionTypes.js: A mapping of the action-type string representations to variables.
	... This is so if we have a typo, the editor will notice it (whereas with a string, it won't)
	2) index.js: an import/export file for individual actions created in the action-creator files.
	... This is used by the components themselves.
